# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM and GRU
## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of Facebook and IBM using deep learning techniques. The datasets used consist of historical stock data, and the experiment used different architectures, such as **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) and **GRU** (Gated Recurrent Units), to capture temporal dependencies.

## Datasets
**FB.csv**: Facebook stock prices from May 18, 2012, to April 1, 2020.

**IBM.csv**: IBM stock prices from January 2, 1962, to April 1, 2020.
